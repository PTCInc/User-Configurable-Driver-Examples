## Overview

Kepware's [User-Configurable Driver (U-CON)](https://www.kepware.com/products/kepserverex/drivers/u-con/) allows users to quickly and easily create a device driver for serial and Ethernet devices for which an off-the-shelf driver is not available, including barcode readers, weigh scales, various sensors, and RTUs. Its intuitive interface was designed for the non-programmer. Users only need a basic knowledge of protocols, the protocol manual, and the device to get started. 

Example profiles for various hardware devices and protocols can be found in this repository. Each example includes a Kepware project file in native OPF format and may include other supporting documentation.

## Prerequisites

Thingworx Kepware Server (TKS) and KEPServerEX (KSE) v5 and up.

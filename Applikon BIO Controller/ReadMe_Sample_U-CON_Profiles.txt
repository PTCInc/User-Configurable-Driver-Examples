Sample U-CON Profiles
*************************************************
The User Configurable (U-CON) driver for KEPServerEX allows users to quickly and easily create a device driver for serial and Ethernet devices for which an off-the-shelf driver is not available (including barcode readers, weigh scales, various sensors, and RTUs). Its intuitive interface was designed for the non-programmer. Users only need a basic knowledge of protocols, the protocol manual, and the device to get started. OPC and other proprietary client interface technologies are handled within KEPServerEX, simplifying client-side communications. The U-CON driver supports all feature sets available within the KEPServerEX communications platform.
